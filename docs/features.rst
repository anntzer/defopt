Features
========

Docstring Styles
----------------

In addition to the standard Sphinx_-style, you can also use Google_- and
Numpy_-style docstrings. These are converted using Napoleon_ [#]_. If you are
using one of these alternate styles and generating documentation with
`sphinx.ext.autodoc`, be sure to also enable `sphinx.ext.napoleon`.

A runnable example is available at `examples/styles.py`_.

Types
-----

Argument types are read from your function's docstring. Both
``param`` and ``type`` are supported. ::

    :param <type> <name>: <description>

::

    :param <name>: <description>
    :type <name>: <type>

``<type>`` is evaluated in the function's global namespace when `defopt.run` is
called. See Booleans_, Lists_, Choices_ and Parsers_ for more information on
specific types.

Subcommands
-----------

If multiple commands are passed to `defopt.run`, they are treated as
subcommands which are run by name. ::

    defopt.run(func1, func2)

The command line usage will indicate this. ::

    usage: test.py [-h] {func1,func2} ...

    positional arguments:
      {func1,func2}

Flags
-----

Any keyword arguments are converted to flags, with all underscores in the name
replaced by hyphens. Names of positional arguments are used unmodified::

    usage: test.py [-h] [--keyword-arg KEYWORD_ARG] positional_arg

    positional arguments:
      positional_arg

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --keyword-arg KEYWORD_ARG

In Python 3, any keyword-only arguments without defaults are marked as required.

If you wish to specify that a particular flag should also have an associated
short version, you can pass a mapping to `defopt.run`::

    defopt.run(main, short={'keyword-arg': 'k'})

Now, ``-k`` is exactly equivalent to ``--keyword-arg``::

      -k KEYWORD_ARG, --keyword-arg KEYWORD_ARG

A runnable example is available at `examples/short.py`_.

Booleans
--------

Boolean keyword arguments are automatically converted to two separate flags:
``--name`` which stores `True` and ``--no-name`` which stores `False`. Your
help text and the default will be displayed next to the ``--name`` flag::

    --flag      Set "flag" to True (default: False)
    --no-flag

Note that this does not apply to mandatory boolean arguments; these must be
specified as one of ``1/t/true`` or ``0/f/false`` (case insensitive).

A runnable example is available at `examples/booleans.py`_.

Lists
-----

Lists are automatically converted to flags which take zero or more arguments.
If the argument is positional, the flag is marked as required.

When declaring that a parameter is a list, use the established convention of
putting the contained type inside square brackets. ::

    :param list[int] numbers: A sequence of numbers

You can now specify your list on the command line using multiple arguments. ::

    test.py --numbers 1 2 3

A runnable example is available at `examples/lists.py`_.

Choices
-------

If one of your argument types is a subclass of `enum.Enum` [#]_, this is
handled specially on the command line to produce more helpful output. ::

    positional arguments:
      {red,blue,yellow}  Your favorite color

This also produces a more helpful message when you choose an invalid option. ::

    test.py: error: argument color: invalid choice: 'black'
                                    (choose from 'red', 'blue', 'yellow')

A runnable example is available at `examples/choices.py`_.

Parsers
-------

You can use arbitrary argument types as long as you provide functions to parse
them from strings. ::

    def parse_person(string):
        last, first = string.split(',')
        return Person(first.strip(), last.strip())

    defopt.run(..., parsers={Person: parse_person})

You can now build ``Person`` objects directly from the command line. ::

    test.py --person "VAN ROSSUM, Guido"

A runnable example is available at `examples/parsers.py`_.

Variable Positional Arguments
-----------------------------

If your function definition contains ``*args``, the parser will accept zero or
more positional arguments. When specifying a type, specify the type of the
elements, not the container. ::

    def main(*numbers):
        """:param int numbers: Positional numeric arguments"""

This will create a parser that accepts zero or more positional arguments which
are individually parsed as integers. They are passed as they would be from code
and received as a tuple. ::

    test.py 1 2 3

Variable keyword arguments (``**kwargs``) are not supported.

Entry Points
------------

To use your script as a console entry point with setuptools, you need to create
a function that can be called without arguments. ::

    def entry_point():
        defopt.run(main)

You can then reference this entry point in your ``setup.py`` file. ::

    setup(
        ...,
        entry_points={'console_scripts': ['name=test:entry_point']}
    )

Annotations
-----------

Python 3 introduced function annotations, and `PEP 0484`_ standardized their
use for type hints.

When passed to `defopt.run`, any function annotations are assumed to be type
hints. `~typing.List`, `~typing.Sequence` and `~typing.Iterable` from the
`typing` module [#]_ are all treated in the same way as `list` (see Lists_). ::

    from typing import Iterable
    def func(arg1: int, arg2: Iterable[float]):
        """No further type information required."""

You may mix annotations with types in your docstring, but if type information
for a parameter is given in both, they must be the same.

A runnable example is available at `examples/annotations.py`_.

.. [#] While Napoleon is included with Sphinx as `sphinx.ext.napoleon`, defopt
   depends on ``sphinxcontrib-napoleon`` so that end users of your command line
   tool are not required to install Sphinx and all of its dependencies.
   However, if Sphinx is installed, defopt can just use that.
.. [#] `enum` was introduced in Python 3.4. If you are using an older version
   of Python, the backport will be installed as a dependency.
.. [#] `typing` was introduced in Python 3.5. If you are using an older version
   of Python, the backport will be installed as a dependency.
