Features

Docstring Styles
----------------

In addition to the standard Sphinx_-style, you can also use Google_- and
Numpy_-style docstrings. These are converted using Napoleon_ [#]_. If you are
using one of these alternate styles and generating documentation with
`sphinx.ext.autodoc`, be sure to also enable `sphinx.ext.napoleon`.

A runnable example is available at `examples/styles.py`_.

Types
-----

Argument types are read from your function's docstring. Both
``param`` and ``type`` (and their variants [#]_) are supported. ::

    :param <type> <name>: <description>

::

    :param <name>: <description>
    :type <name>: <type>

``<type>`` is evaluated in the function's global namespace when `defopt.run`
is called. See Booleans_, Lists_, Choices_, Tuples_ and Parsers_ for more
information on specific types.

Type information can be automatically added to the help text by passing
``show_types=True`` to `defopt.run`.

Subcommands
-----------

If a list of commands are passed to `defopt.run`, they are treated as
subcommands which are run by name. ::

    defopt.run([func1, func2])

The command line usage will indicate this. ::

    usage: test.py [-h] {func1,func2} ...

    positional arguments:
      {func1,func2}

Flags
-----

Any keyword arguments are converted to flags, with all underscores in
the name replaced by hyphens. Names of positional arguments are used
unmodified.  By default, short flags are generated for keyword arguments
that do not share their initial with other keyword arguments::

    usage: test.py [-h] [-k KEYWORD_ARG] positional_arg

    positional arguments:
      positional_arg

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -k KEYWORD_ARG, --keyword-arg KEYWORD_ARG

In Python 3, any keyword-only arguments without defaults are marked as
required.  Additionally, if at least one keyword-only argument is present,
then only such arguments will be converted to a flag; positional-or-keyword
arguments that have a default will be treated as positional but optional on the
command line::

    usage: test.py [-h] [-k KEYWORD_ONLY] [positional_with_default]

    positional arguments:
      positional_with_default

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -k KEYWORD_ONLY, --keyword-only KEYWORD_ONLY

To force an argument to be treated as positional but optional in the absence of
flags, a dummy `private argument`_ can be used, e.g.::

    @defopt.run
    def main(positional_with_default="foo", *, _=None):
        """:type positional_with_default: str"""

You can override these generated short flags by passing a dictionary to
`defopt.run` which maps flag names to single letters::

    defopt.run(main, short={'keyword-arg': 'a'})

Now, ``-a`` is exactly equivalent to ``--keyword-arg``::

      -a KEYWORD_ARG, --keyword-arg KEYWORD_ARG

A runnable example is available at `examples/short.py`_.

Passing an empty dictionary suppresses automatic short flag generation, without
adding new flags.

Booleans
--------

Boolean keyword arguments are automatically converted to two separate flags:
``--name`` which stores `True` and ``--no-name`` which stores `False`. Your
help text and the default will be displayed next to the ``--name`` flag::

    --flag      Set "flag" to True
                (default: False)
    --no-flag

Note that this does not apply to mandatory boolean arguments; these must be
specified as one of ``1/t/true`` or ``0/f/false`` (case insensitive).

A runnable example is available at `examples/booleans.py`_.

Lists
-----

Lists are automatically converted to flags which take zero or more arguments.
If the argument is positional, the flag is marked as required.

When declaring that a parameter is a list, use the established convention of
putting the contained type inside square brackets. ::

    :param list[int] numbers: A sequence of numbers

You can now specify your list on the command line using multiple arguments. ::

    test.py --numbers 1 2 3

A runnable example is available at `examples/lists.py`_.

Choices
-------

If one of your argument types is a subclass of `enum.Enum` [#]_, this is
handled specially on the command line to produce more helpful output. ::

    positional arguments:
      {red,blue,yellow}  Your favorite color

This also produces a more helpful message when you choose an invalid option. ::

    test.py: error: argument color: invalid choice: 'black'
                                    (choose from 'red', 'blue', 'yellow')

A runnable example is available at `examples/choices.py`_.

Tuples
------

Typed tuples and typed namedtuples (as defined using `typing.Tuple` and
`typing.NamedTuple`) consume as many command-line arguments as the tuple
has fields, convert each argument to the correct type, and wrap them into the
annotation class.  When a `typing.NamedTuple` is used for an optional argument,
the names of the fields are used in the help.

Parsers
-------

You can use arbitrary argument types as long as you provide functions to parse
them from strings. ::

    def parse_person(string):
        last, first = string.split(',')
        return Person(first.strip(), last.strip())

    defopt.run(..., parsers={Person: parse_person})

You can now build ``Person`` objects directly from the command line. ::

    test.py --person "VAN ROSSUM, Guido"

A runnable example is available at `examples/parsers.py`_.

Variable Positional Arguments
-----------------------------

If your function definition contains ``*args``, the parser will accept zero or
more positional arguments. When specifying a type, specify the type of the
elements, not the container. ::

    def main(*numbers):
        """:param int numbers: Positional numeric arguments"""

This will create a parser that accepts zero or more positional arguments which
are individually parsed as integers. They are passed as they would be from code
and received as a tuple. ::

    test.py 1 2 3

If the argument is a list type (see Lists_ and Annotations_), this will instead
create a flag that can be specified multiple times, each time creating a new
list.

Variable keyword arguments (``**kwargs``) are not supported.

A runnable example is available at `examples/starargs.py`_.

.. _private argument:

Private Arguments
-----------------

Arguments whose name start with an underscore will not be added to the parser.

Entry Points
------------

To use your script as a console entry point with setuptools, you need to create
a function that can be called without arguments. ::

    def entry_point():
        defopt.run(main)

You can then reference this entry point in your ``setup.py`` file. ::

    setup(
        ...,
        entry_points={'console_scripts': ['name=test:entry_point']}
    )

Annotations
-----------

Python 3 introduced function annotations, and `PEP 0484`_ standardized their
use for type hints.

When passed to `defopt.run`, any function annotations are assumed to be type
hints. `~typing.List`, `~typing.Sequence` and `~typing.Iterable` from the
`typing` module [#]_ are all treated in the same way as `list` (see Lists_). ::

    from typing import Iterable
    def func(arg1: int, arg2: Iterable[float]):
        """No further type information required."""

You may mix annotations with types in your docstring, but if type information
for a parameter is given in both, they must be the same.

A runnable example is available at `examples/annotations.py`_.
