Changelog
=========

next
----
* Fixed ``typing.Optional[bool]`` to still be treated as a flag.
* Added support for ``tuple[X, ...]`` and ``Collection[X]`` (Thanks to
  @neelmraman).

6.2.0 (2021-11-24)
------------------
* Bumped docutils dependency to >=0.12, for setuptools compatibility.
* Added support for Python 3.10, and for ``A | B``-style unions (only on that
  version of Python).
* Fixed bad interaction between custom None parsers and tuple parsers.
* Give preference to None parsers in Unions.
* `defopt.signature` annotates the return type with the documented raisable
  exception types.
* Added `defopt.bind` to allow preprocessing arguments before performing the
  call.
* Added the ability to use nested subcommands.

6.1.0 (2021-02-25)
------------------
* Boolean flags are now implemented using a variant of
  ``argparse.BooleanOptionalAction``.
* Added ``no_negated_flags``.
* A custom parser set for ``type(None)`` now affects parsing of
  `typing.Optional` too.

------------------
* Don't get tripped by Attributes sections.
* Added support for Python 3.9.

6.0.1 (2020-09-18)

* Assume that types annotated as constructible from a single str are their own
  parser.

* Added support for passing functions as a ``{name: function}`` mapping (Thanks
  to @johnfarina).
* Removed support for Python<=3.4.
* Disallowed ``parsers=None`` as a synonym for ``parsers={}``.
* Added `defopt.signature` to separate the signature-and-docstring parsing from
  the ArgumentParser construction.
* Fixed removal of comments from help string.
* Added support for ``--version``.
* Fixed displaying of defaults for parameters with no help, and added
  ``show_defaults``.
* Support varargs documented under ``*args`` instead of ``args``.
* Support standard Sphinx roles in the Python domain (``:py:func:``,
  ``:func:``, etc.); they are just stripped out.
* Arbitrary type-hinted functions can now by run with
  ``python -mdefopt dotted.name args ...``, as if ``dotted.name`` was passed
  to `defopt.run`.
* Support more RST constructs: doctest blocks, rubrics (used by Napoleon for
  sectioning).
